      <div id="description"> <p<i> Movement <i> is a short video that explores the definition of movement, motion and time. 
        The video is made of a compilation of short footages of moving subjects.
        Each footage focuses only on one type of movement; the object is either falling or moving from right to left.
         The sequences are then put together to create a relationship between each of them.
         All the subjects seem to follow the same motion (right to left) through all the video.
         These objects that move normally independently from each other suddenly create a whole.
         Movement's purpose is to make the audience think about how small everyday life events can become meaningful when put together. </p>
