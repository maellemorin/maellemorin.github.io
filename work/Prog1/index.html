        <p> Hunting Owl is like the Breakout Game, but played upside down.
        The player needs to drop owls to catch mice. Each time an owl catches a mouse, the score increase.
        When the owl reach the bottom of the screen, the player has to catch it before it dies.
        If the owl is not caught, the mice that the owl ate come back to life.
        The moving mice and the eagle are there to increase the difficulty of the game.
        Indeed, if the eagle catches the owl, it dies.
        Hunting Owl was modelled after the Breakout Mod by Julian Glass-Pilon.
        All graphics were made in Processing using primitive shapes. </p>
